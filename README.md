# nodemySQL
my first node mysql database
this app runs from the command line
to get started you have to npm install; I have included a package.json
the app is pretty straight foward from there, just follow the prompt instructions. 
I have attached screenshots of the code.
heres a link to a demo https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wo0VSxOm1GR2gH4jhYIzYn3gsDv9ccqw/view?usp=sharing
